Copy as RTF TextMate bundle
===========================

Need to copy + paste some text and _keep_ the syntax highlighting?

Yes you do. All the time. For Keynote presentations. And probably other reasons.

Install this bundle, and after selecting some pretty syntax highlighted text,
use Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+R to copy it as RTF (rich text format) Now you can 
paste it directly into Keynote presentations. And other places where RTF is supported.


Installation
============

    cd ~/"Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles"
    git clone git://github.com/drnic/copy-as-rtf-tmbundle.git "Copy as RTF.tmbundle"
    
Inside TextMate, click "Reload Bundles."
